<Goals>
  - used Astro `<style></style>` tags to style items on the page
  - defined and used CSS variables using `define:vars` directive
  - applied some styles globally by adding a `global.css` file
</Goals>

Now that you have more content on your page, let's style it!

Using Astro's own `<style></style>` tags, you can style items on your page. Adding **attributes** and **directives** to these tags gives you even more ways to style.

## Styling an Individual Page

1. Copy the following code and paste it into `src/pages/about.astro` immediately after the code fence, before the `<html>` tag:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
   
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
    </style>
    ```

    Check all three pages in your browser preview. Which color is the page title of:

    - your Home page?  || _black_ ||
    - your About page? || _purple_ ||
    - your Blog page? || _black_ ||

    :::tip
    If you are unable to determine colors visually, you can use the dev tools in your browser to inspect the `<h1>` title elements and verify the text color applied.
    :::

2. Add the following code to your existing style tag:

     ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={5-8}
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: green;
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    </style>
    ```

3. Update the list of skills on your About page by adding the class name `skill` to the generated `<li>` element. Your code should now look like this:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" 'class="skill"'
    <p>My skills are:<p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    ```

  4. Visit your About page in your browser again, and verify, through visual inspection or through dev tools, that each item in your list of skills is now green and bold.

## CSS Variables
The Astro `<style>` tag can also reference any variables from your frontmatter script using the `define:vars={...}` directive. You can **define variables within your code fence**, then **use them as CSS variables in your style tag**.

1. Add the following code into the frontmatter script of `src/pages/about.astro`

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    ---
    const skillColor = "green"
    ---
    ```

2. Update your existing `<style>` tag below to first define, then use this `skillColor` variable.

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" "define:vars={{skillColor}}" "var(--skillColor)" del={6} ins={7}
    <style define:vars={{skillColor}}>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: green;
        color: var(--skillColor);
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    </style>
    ```

3. Check your About page in your browser preview, and and once again, you should not notice any changes! The color green is still being applied, but now through the `define:vars` directive.

## Try it Yourself!
 
 1. Update the `<style>` tag on your About page so that it matches the one below. 

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    <style define:vars={{skillColor, fontWeight, textCase, bulletStyle}}>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: var(--skillColor);
        font-weight: var(--fontWeight);
        text-transform: var(--textCase);
      }
      ul li::marker {
        content: var(--bulletStyle);
      }
    </style>
    ```
 
 2. Add any missing variable definitions in your frontmatter script so that your new `<style>` tag successfully applies these styles to your list of skills:
 - the text color is green
 - the text is bold
 - the list items are in all-caps (all uppercase letters)
 - the list bullets are asterisks (*)

<summary>Show me the code!</summary>

```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
---
const skillColor = "green"
const fontWeight = "bold"
const textCase = "uppercase"
const bulletStyle = "'*'"
---
```
</details>

## Global Styles
You have seen that the Astro `<style>` tag is **scoped by default**, meaning that it only affects the elements in its own file.

There are a few ways to define styles **globally** in Astro, but in this tutorial, you will create and import a `global.css` file into each of your pages. This combination of stylesheet and `<style>` tag gives you the ability to control some styles site-wide, and to apply some specific styles exactly where you want them.

1. Create a new file at the location `src/styles/global.css` (You'll have to create a `styles` folder first.)

2. Copy the following code into your new file, `global.css`

    ```css title="src/styles/global.css"
    html {
      background-color: #00539F;
    }
    body {
      background-color: #E2CAF1;
      margin: 0 auto;
      width: 80%;
      max-width: 80ch;
      padding: 1em;
      border: 5px solid black;
    }

    h1 {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 20px 0;
      color: #00539F;
      text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px grey;
    }
    ```
3. In `about.astro`, add the following import statment anywhere in your frontmatter: 

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={2}
    ---
    import '../styles/global.css'
    ---
    ```

4. Check the browser preview of your About page, and you should now see new styles applied!

## Try it Yourself
Add the necessary line of code to each `.astro` file in your project to apply your global styles to every page of your site!

<details>
<summary>Show me the code!</summary>

Add the following import statement to the two other page files: `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/blog.astro`

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import '../styles/global.css'
---
```
</details>


## Style your Social Media Component

1. Add the following `<style>` tag to `src/components/Social.astro` and corresponding `class` to the `<span>` element:

    ```astro title="src/components/social.astro" ins={6-17} 'class="social-platform'
    ---
    const {platform, username} = Astro.props
    ---
    <span class="social-platform"><a href={`https://www.${platform}.com/${username}`}>{platform}</a></span>

    <style>
      .social-platform {
        margin: 0.4em;
        padding: 1em;
        background-color: #ff9776;
        border-radius: 3px;
      }
      a {
        color: #00539F;
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    </style>
    ```

2. Add the following HTML element with a corresponding `<style>` tag to `src/components/footer.astro` to separate your footer from the rest of the page content. 

    ```astro title="src/components/footer.astro" ins={4-8,10}
    ---
    import Social from './Social.astro'
    ---
    <style>
       .spacer {
           height: 2em;
       }
    </style>

    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <Social platform="twitter" username="astrodotbuild" />
    <Social platform="github" username="withastro" />
    <Social platform="youtube" username="astrodotbuild" />
    ```

3. Check your browser preview again and confirm that each page shows an updated footer.

## Before you go

### Analyze the Pattern
Your About page is now styled using *both* the imported `global.css` file *and* a `<style>` tag.

- Are styles from both styling methods being applied? 

    || Yes ||

- Are there any conflicting styles, and if so, which are applied?

    || Yes, `h1` is defined as blue globally, but purple locally in the `<style>` tag. The purple color is applied.  ||

- Describe how `global.css` and `<style>` work together.

    || When conflicting styles are defined both globally and in a page's local `<script>` tag, the local styles should overwrite any global styles. (But, there can be other factors involved, so always visually inspect your site to make sure your styles are properly applied!)  ||

- How would you choose whether to declare a style in a `global.css` file or a `<style>` tag?

    || If you want a style to be applied site-wide, you would choose to use a `global.css` file. However, if you want styles to apply to only the HTML content in a single `.astro` file, and not affect other elements on your site, you would choose a `<style>` tag. ||

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="style">
- [ ] I can add CSS styles to HTML elements on a page using an Astro `<style>` tag.
- [ ] I can use variables from my frontmatter script in my CSS to style elements on the page.
- [ ] I can define global CSS styles in a `.css` file located elsewhere in my project, and I understand how they work with local `<style>` tags.
</Checklist>

- [CSS variables in Astro](/en/guides/styling/#css-variables)

## Adding Styles to Tag List

1. Add the following CSS classes to style both your `<div>` and each `<p>` that will be generated. Note: Astro uses HTML syntax for adding class names!

    ```astro title="src/pages/tags/index.astro" 'class="tags"'
    <div class="tags">
    ```

    ```astro title="src/pages/tags/index.astro" 'class="tag"'
    <p class="tag">
    ```

2. Define these new CSS classes by adding the following `<style>` tag to this page:

    ```astro title="src/pages/tags/index.astro"
    <style>
      a {
        color: #00539F;
      }
            
      .tags {
        display: flex; 
        flex-wrap: wrap; 
        margin: 0 auto;  
      }

      .tag {
        margin: 0.25em;
        border: dotted 1px #a1a1a1;
        border-radius: .5em;
        padding: .5em 1em;
        font-size: 1.15em;
        background-color: #F8FCFD;
      }
    </style>
    ```

3. Check your browser preview at `localhost:3000/tags` to verify that you have some new styles, and that each of the tags on the page has a working link to its own individual tag page.
