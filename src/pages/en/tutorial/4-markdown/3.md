Now that you have your first `.md` blog post written, let's make it look like the rest of the pages on your website!

<Goals>
  - created two new blog pages for your site
  - nested a layout for Markdown posts inside your main page layout
  - passed each blog post's title to `BaseLayout.astro` for updating page metadata
</Goals>

## Nesting Layouts

You already have a `BaseLayout.astro` for defining the overall layout of your pages. 

`MarkdownPostLayout.astro` gives you some additional templating for common blog post properties such as `title` and `date`, but your blog posts don't look like the other pages on your site. You can achieve that by **nesting layouts**.


1. In `src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro`, import `BaseLayout.astro` and use it to wrap the entire template content. Don't forget to pass the `pageTitle` prop:

    ```astro title="src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro" ins={2,5,12}
    ---
    import BaseLayout from './BaseLayout.astro';
    const { frontmatter } = Astro.props;
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={frontmatter.title}>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <p>{frontmatter.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
      <p><em>{frontmatter.description}</em></p>
      <p>Written by: {frontmatter.author}</p>
      <img src={frontmatter.postImage} width="300" />
      <slot />
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

2. Check your browser preview at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1`. Now you should see content rendered by:

    - Your **main page layout**, including your styles, navigation links and social footer.
    - Your **blog post layout**, including frontmatter properties like the description, date, title and image
    - Your **individual blog post Markdown content**, including just the text written in this post
    
3. Notice that your page title is now displayed twice, once by each layout.

    Remove the line that displays your page title from `MarkdownPostLayout.astro`:

    ```astro title="src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro" del={2}
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={frontmatter.title}>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <p>{frontmatter.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
      <p><em>{frontmatter.description}</em></p>
      <p>Written by: {frontmatter.author}</p>
      <img src={frontmatter.postImage} width="300" />
      <slot />
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

5. Check your browser preview again at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1` and verify that this link is no longer displayed and that your title is only displayed once. Make any other adjustments necessary to ensure that you do not have any duplicated content.

## Linking to your posts

Add navigation links for each individual blog post (including new ones you will create next).

1. Add the following HTML links to `src/pages/blog.astro`:

    ```astro title="src/pages/blog.astro" ins={7-11}
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro'
    const pageTitle = "My Astro Learning Blog"
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
      <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/posts/post-1/">Post 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="/posts/post-2/">Post 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="/posts/post-3/">Post 3</a></li>
      </ul>
      </BaseLayout>
    ```

2. Now, add two more files in `src/posts/`: `post-2.md` and `post-3.md`. Here is some sample code you can copy and paste into your files, or, you can create your own!

    ```md title="src/pages/posts/post-2.md"
    ---
    layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
    title: My Second Blog Post
    author: Astro Learner
    description: "After learning some Astro, I couldn't stop!"
    image: 
        url: "https://astro.build/assets/blog/astro-showcase/astro-showcase-screenshot.jpg"
        alt: "Thumbnails of websites from the Astro Showcase site."
    pubDate: 2022-07-08
    tags: ["astro", "blogging", "learning in public","successes"]
    ---
    After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!
    ```

    ```md title="src/pages/posts/post-3.md"
    ---
    layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
    title: My Third Blog Post
    author: Astro Learner
    description: "I had some challenges, but asking in the community really helped!"
    image: 
        url: "https://astro.build/assets/blog/community-day/cover.jpg"
        alt: "The word community with a heart."
    pubDate: 2022-07-15
    tags: ["astro", "learning in public", "setbacks", "community"]
    ---
    It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!
    ```

3. Check your browser preview and make sure that:

    - All your links for Post 1, Post 2 and Post 3 lead to a working page on your site. (If you find a mistake, check your links on `blog.astro` or your Markdown file names!)

    - Each blog post shows the same page template, and no content is missing. (If one of your blog posts is missing content, check its frontmatter properties.)

    - No content is duplicated on a page. (If something is being rendered twice, then be sure to remove it from `MarkdownPostLayout.astro`.)

    If you'd like to customize your page template, you can.


## Before you go

### Test your knowledge

Fill in the blanks using the following words or phrases: **`.md`**, **blog**, **component attribute**, **props**, **`BaseLayout`**, **component-based design**, 

Because Astro uses || **component-based design** ||, you can nest one layout inside another and take advantage of working with modular pieces. This is particularly helpful when creating a || **blog** ||, so that a || **`BaseLayout`** || can just concern itself with main page styling, while a `MarkdownPostLayout` can focus on specific templating that is only used for your Markdown posts. 

This means that some values defined in a ||  **`.md`**  ||  file might need to be passed as || **props** ||  through multiple layers of layouts, first to its immediate `layout` inside a `content` object. Then, from there, it can be passed to any other Astro component, including another layout, as a ||   **component attribute**   ||.

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="pages">
- [ ] I can create multiple blog posts, and I can access them all through individual links on my Blog page.
- [ ] I can nest layouts, and decide which layout will be responsible for which content.
</Checklist>
