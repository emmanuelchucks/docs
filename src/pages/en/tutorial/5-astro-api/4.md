## Installing Astro's RSS Package

Astro provdes a custom package to quickly add an RSS feed to your website. 

This official package generates a non-HTML document with information about all of your blog posts that can be read by **feed readers** like Feedly, The Old Reader and more. This document is updated everytime your site is rebuilt. (Remember, this happens automatically when you commit to GitHub and Netlify rebuilds and redeploys your site.) 

Individuals can subscribe to your feed in a feed reader, and receive notification when you publish a new blog post on your site, making it a popular blog feature.

1. Quit the Astro development server by pressing `CTRL + C` to give you access to commands in the terminal.

2. Run the following command in the terminal to install Astro's RSS package, and wait for the package to successfully install.

    ```shell
    npm install @astrojs/rss
    ```

3. Restart the dev server to begin working on your Astro project again.

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

## Create an `.xml` feed document

1. Create a new file in `src/pages/` called `rss.xml.js`

2. Copy the following code into this new document, replacing the `site` property with your site's own unique Netlify URL (You can customize the `title` and `description` properties, too!):

    ```js
    // src/pages/rss.xml.js

    import rss from '@astrojs/rss';

    export const get = () => rss({
      title: 'Astro Learner | Blog',
      description: 'My journey learning Astro',
      site: 'https://my-blog-site.netlify.app',
      items: import.meta.glob('./**/*.md'),
      customData: `<language>en-us</language>`,
    });
    ```

3. Becausse this `rss.xml` document is only created when your site is built, you won't be able to see this page in your browser during development. Quit the dev server and run the following commands to first, build your site locally and second, view a preview of your build:

```sh
npm run build

npm run preview
```

4. Visit `localhost:3000/rss.xml` and verify that you can see (unformatted) text on the page with an `item` for each of your `.md` files. Each item should contain information such as `title`, `url` and `description`.

    :::tip[view your rss feed in a reader]
    Download a feed reader, or sign up for an online feed reader service and subscribe to your site by adding your own Netlify URL. You can also share this link with others so they can subscribe to your posts, and be notified when a new one is published.
    :::

5. Be sure to quit the preview (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) and restart the dev server when you want to view your site in development again.
