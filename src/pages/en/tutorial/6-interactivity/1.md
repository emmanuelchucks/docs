To give your blog readers the option of viewing your site in either light mode or dark mode, let's create an interactive UI theme toggle switch. 

<Goals>
  - made a new theme toggle UI component to switch your site between light and dark mode
  - defined global styles for both a light and a dark theme
  - used JavaScript within a `<script>` tag to make your toggle button interactive
  - refactored your JavaScript to a local project `.js` file
</Goals>

## Theme toggle component

1. Create a new file at `src/components/ThemeToggle.astro` and paste the following code into it:

    ```astro title="src/components/ThemeToggle.astro"
    ---
    ---
    <div>
      <label>
        <input id="toggler" type="checkbox">
      </label>
    </div>
    ```

2. Add the theme toggle to `BaseLayout.astro` so that it will be displayed on all pages. Don't forget to import the component using its relative location!

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro" ins={4,17}
    ---
    import Navigation from '../components/Navigation.astro';
    import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
    import ThemeToggle from '../components/ThemeToggle.astro';
    import '../styles/global.css';

    const { title } = Astro.props
    ---
    <html lang = "en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>{title}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <Navigation />
        <ThemeToggle />
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <slot />        
        <Footer />
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. Visit your browser preview at `localhost:3000` to see this component now rendered to your page. Click on it to see what happens.

## Add CSS styling for each theme

To make your text and background different colors in each theme, define some CSS variables.

1. Define text and background style colors for both a light (default) and dark theme in `global.css`. You can choose your own, or copy and paste:

    ```css title="src/styles/global.css"
    /* Default Light Mode Theme */
    :root, [data-theme="default"] {
      --body-bg-color: #E2CAF1;
      --text-color: #333;
    }

    /* Dark Mode Theme */
    [data-theme="dark"] {
      --body-bg-color: #0D0950;
      --text-color: #fff;
    }
    ```

2. Edit your existing CSS so that both the text and background colors for your entire website are defined by CSS variables, which now depend on your theme choice:

    ```css title="src/styles/global.css" del={2} ins={3,4,7}
    body {
      background-color: #E2CAF1;    
      background-color: var(--body-bg-color);
      transition: background-color .45s ease-in;    
    }

    * {
      color: var(--text-color);
    }
    ```

3. Visit your site in your browser preview and click the theme toggle. Notice what does or does not change!

    Now, you have an HTML element at the top of your page, under your navigation links. As a checkbox, clicking on it does *something.* (Remember, an HTML checkbox can toggle between displaying an empty box and a checked box, no JavaScript required.) But, an HTML input element can only change its own appearance. 

    You will need JavaScript to monitor whether the toggle switch has been clicked, and then change the properties of *other* HTML elements in response.

## Add client-side interactivity

To provide **client-side JavaScript** (interactivity that can be prompted by the user), use a `<script>` tag in an Astro component template. 

### Using JS in script tags

1. Add the following `<script>` tag in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro" ins={1-7}
    <script>
      document.getElementById('toggler').addEventListener('change', (event) => {
        event.target.checked 
          ? document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')
          : document.body.removeAttribute('data-theme')
        });
      </script>
    </body>
    ```

    This script "listens" for a change to the checkbox, and sets or removes a `data-theme` dark mode attribute to the page `<body>` in response.

2. Check your browser preview at `localhost:3000` and click the theme toggle. Verify that you can change between light and dark modes.

    Your site now has an interactive UI element, thanks to a `<script>` tag in your HTML template!

:::note
Although you have already used some JavaScript to build parts of your site (e.g. mapping through a list of skills on the About page, fetching information from your Markdown files, creating page routes dynamically), those commands are all executed **at build time to create static HTML for your site**, and then the code is "thrown away." 

This is the first JavaScript for your site that is sent to the browser, and is available to run, and re-run, based on user interactions like refreshing a page or toggling an input.

## CSS Extra - Style your toggle

This theme toggle element is an HTML checkbox, but it won't look like one when you're done with it! 

Adding some CSS classes to the HTML that defines your checkbox, and some new CSS classes to your global CSS styles, you will make this plain checkbox look like a sliding toggle instead. Don't worry if you find the CSS styles a little overwhelming. You can just copy and paste for now, and examine the details later!

1. Add the following CSS classes to `ThemeToggle.astro`, including a new line with a `<span>` element:

    ```astro title="src/components/ThemeToggle.astro" 'class="toggle"' 'class="switch"' ins={6}
    ---
    ---
    <div class="toggle">
      <label class="switch">
        <input id="toggler" type="checkbox">
        <span class="slider"></span>
      </label>
    </div>
    ```

2. Copy the following CSS into `global.css` to style the HTML input that will create the toggle switch, with slider:

    ```css title="src/styles/global.css"
    .toggle {
      margin-top: 2em;
    }

    .switch {
      position: relative;
      display: inline-block;
      width: 48px;
      height: 20px;
    }

    /* Hide default HTML checkbox */
    .switch input {
      -webkit-appearance: none;
      appearance: none;
    }

    .slider {
      position: absolute;
      cursor: pointer;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
      bottom: 0;
      background-color: #333;
      border-radius: 20px;
      -webkit-transition: .4s;
      transition: .4s;
    }

    .slider::before {
      position: absolute;
      content: "";
      height: 12px;
      width: 12px;
      left: 4px;
      bottom: 4px;
      background-color: var(--toggler-color);
      border-radius: 50%;
      transition: .4s;
    }

    input:checked + .slider {
      background-color: #fff;
    }

    input:checked + .slider::before {
      transform: translateX(26px);
    }
    ```

3. Update your CSS variables to include a `toggler-color` so that your toggle switch itself changes color depending on the theme.

    ```css title="src/styles/global.css" ins={5,12}
    /* Default Light Mode Theme */
    :root, [data-theme="default"] {
      --body-bg-color: #E2CAF1;
      --text-color: #333;
      --toggler-color: #fff;
    }

    /* Dark Mode Theme */
    [data-theme="dark"] {
      --body-bg-color: #0D0950;
      --text-color: #fff;
      --toggler-color: #333;
    }
    ```

4. Check your browser preview, and see your new styled theme toggle in action!

### Importing a `.js` file

Just like you can refactor parts of your template into smaller Astro components, you can also move the contents of `<script>` tags into separate `.js` files. Then, you can import that file into your `<script>` tag.


1. Create `src/scripts/toggle-theme.js` (you will have to create a new `/scripts/` folder) and move your JavaScript into it.

    ```js title="src/scripts/toggle-theme.js"
    document.getElementById('toggler').addEventListener('change', (event) => {
        event.target.checked 
        ? document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')
        : document.body.removeAttribute('data-theme')
    });
    ```

2. Replace the contents of the `<script>` tag in `BaseLayout.astro` with this file import (note the relative location used, as with other imports from files within your project).

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro" ins={8-10} del={1-7}
     <script>
      document.getElementById('toggler').addEventListener('change', (event) => {
        event.target.checked 
          ? document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')
          : document.body.removeAttribute('data-theme')
        });
      </script>
      <script>
        import "../scripts/theme-toggle.js";
      </script>
    </body>
    ```

3. Check your browser preview again and verify that the theme toggle still works. 

:::note[limitations]
Although this toggle works on every page, your theme choice does not persist across pages or page refreshes. Writing the toggle state to `localStorage` is one way you can add this functionality to your website, but it is beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial.

## Before you go

### Test your knowledge

Fill in the blanks with the following terms:  **code fences**, **build-time**, **written or imported**, **browser**, **JavaScript**, 

|| **JavaScript** || is a programming language that can add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.  Astro uses JavaScript first at || **build-time** || to create your site (e.g. to build dynamic routes, to map over arrays of data to display lists, to fetch data and to define variables). Then, Astro can optionally send JavaScript to the || **browser** || (also known as client-side JavaScript) which allows users to interact with your website and change parts of your built site (e.g. toggling switches, clicking on buttons).

In Astro, JavaScript that is only meant to build your site is written between the || **code fences** ||, is run on a server (e.g. Netlify), and then discarded once your site is published. JavaScript that is meant to control interactive elements on your site is || **written or imported** || between open and close `<script>` tags.

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="theme">
- [ ] I can create small Astro UI components and include them on multiple pages by importing and using them in a layout.
- [ ] I can define CSS variables, and update my existing CSS to use them.
- [ ] I can add client-side interactivity on my site by writing JavaScript within a `<script>` tag
- [ ] I can write JavaScript in a `.js` file elsewhere within my project `src`, and import it into a `<script>` tag.
</Checklist>
