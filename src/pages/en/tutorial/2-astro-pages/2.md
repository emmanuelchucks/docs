Now that you have a multi-page website with HTML content, let's add some **Astro Script**!

<Goals>
  - defined variables in your `about.astro` file's script section, and then used them in its HTML template section
  - written a combination of static and dynamic HTML for your About page
  - used values defined in frontmatter script to conditionally display HTML elements on your About page
</Goals>

Any HTML file is valid Astro language. You can write any text inside HTML elements and Astro will render that **static** (literal) content to the page. But, you can do more with Astro than just regular HTML!

An `.astro` file also has a section at the top for **frontmatter**. This script area can contain JavaScript or TypeScript and allows you to add **dynamic** HTML content to your page template. This is content that depends on and is determined by **values defined elsewhere**, not static text typed directly into your HTML element.


## Define and use a variable

Open `about.astro` which should look like this:

```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
---

---
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset ="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Astro</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <a href="/">Home</blog>
        <a href="/about/">About</blog>
        <a href="/blog/">Blog</blog>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

        <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

        <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

1. Add the following line of JavaScript in the Astro script section (at the top of your file, between the **code fences**):

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={2}
    ---
    const pageTitle = "About Me"
    ---
    ```

2. Replace the static "About Me" heading in the body of your HTML with the dynamic variable `{pageTitle}`.

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" del={1} ins={2}
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
    ```

3. Refresh the live preview of your `/about` page.
  
  Your site should look the same! 

  Instead of typing text directly into HTML tags, you just **defined and then used a variable** in the two sections of your `.astro` file, respectively.

4. Use the same pattern to display a page title for `index.astro` ("Home Page") and `blog.astro` ("My Astro Learning Blog").

:::note[Takeaway]
- **Define** variables in your Astro script using JavaScript or TypeScript expressions.
- **Use** these variables in your Astro template inside curly braces { } to tell Astro you're using some script.
:::

:::tip
Astro's templating syntax is similar to JSX syntax. If you're ever wondering how to use your script in your HTML, then searching for how it is done in JSX is probably a good starting point!
:::

## Script expressions in templating

1. Add the following lines to your frontmatter script to **define variables**:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={3-4}
    ---
    const pageTitle = "About Me"
    const goal = 3
    const time = "days"
    const happy = true
    const finished = false
    ---
    ```

2. Then, add the following Astro syntax using these variables to your HTML template, below your existing `<p>` tags:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    <p>I want to finish this tutorial in {goal} {time}.</p> 
    <p>But, it's ok if it takes me twice as long, and I finish in {goal*2}!</p>
    ```

3. Check the site preview in your browser, and you should now see these two new sentences appear:

    > - I want to finish this tutorial in 3 days.
    > - But, it's ok if it takes me twice as long, and I finish in 6!

## Analyze the patterns
1. How do you **define a value** for use inside an Astro file?

    || _use a `const` statement in the frontmatter script, between the code fences_ ||

2. Which pair of symbols tells Astro that you want to **use script** instead of plain text inside your HTML elements?

    || _curly braces_ ||

## Conditional Rendering

You can also use your script variables to choose **whether or not** to render individual elements of your HTML `<body>` content.

1. Add the following lines to your frontmatter script to **define variables**:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={5-6}
    ---
    const pageTitle = "About Me"
    const goal = 3
    const time = "days"
    const happy = true
    const finished = false
    ---
    ```

2. Add the following lines of Astro within the `<body></body>` tags of `about.astro`, below your existing paragraphs.

    Then, check the live preview in your browser tab to see what is displayed on the page:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" /:|&&/ "?"
    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
    ```

    :::note
    Regular JavaScript patterns and expressions will work inside curly braces in your HTML template!
    :::

3. Commit your changes to GitHub before moving on. Do this any time you want to save your work and update your live website!

## Before you go

### Test your knowledge

Given the following `.astro` script:

```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
---
operatingSystem = "Linux"
quantity = 3
footwear = "boots"
student = false
---
```

For each Astro template expression, write out the HTML output that will be displayed in the browser:

1.  `<p>{operatingSytem}</p>`

    ||  `<p>Linux</p>` ||

2.  `{student && <p>I am still in school.</p>}`

    || Nothing with display! ||

3.  `<p>I have {quantity + 8} pairs of {clothing}</p>`

    ||  `<p>I have 11 pairs of boots</p>` ||

4.  `{operatingSystem === "MacOS" ? <p>I am using a Mac.</p> : <p>I am not using a Mac.</p>}`

    || `<p>I am not using a Mac.</p>` ||

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="dynamic">
- [ ] I can define values in my Astro script and render these values in HTML elements.
- [ ] I can conditionally render entire HTML elements using JavaScript expressions and logical operators.
</Checklist>
